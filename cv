## About me
I want to develop myself as a QA specialist that can use all helpful instruments. So, now I am studying JavaScript because I want to be able write and support autotests for any UI in the near future.

## Skills

* Git

## Code example
function multiply(a, b){
return  a * b
}

## My experience in a nutshell 
* February 2021 — current — Deutsche Telekom IT Solutions (T-Systems Russia)
As a manual tester I am responsible for quality of the frontend part of our service. I am checking how these UIs look and work.

    + Manual testing of different services and products (more than 3 years in total)
    + Technical support (2nd and 3rd lines) for Yandex.Disk (part-time, 20 hours per week for 3 years)
